# Homework2

Our first class project will be scaffoled into three components:

1. A project proposal (this HW assignment)
2. A first submission (which I'll give you feedback)
3. A final submission 


## 10 points

For the project proposal, please submit:
- a paragraph description of the dataset youâ€™d like to use,
- a link to the dataset (or include it in your repo)
- a succint research question
- and at least one data visualization.

Here are a few places you can find datasets: [http://kaggle.com/datasets](http://kaggle.com/datasets), [http://data.gov](http://data.gov), [https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/data-in-brief/](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/data-in-brief/), [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), or [https://datasetsearch.research.google.com](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com)
